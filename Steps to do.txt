1. Segmentation
	- Selective search in 3D --> convey 2D method into 3D
		Let user to decide, e.g. with PCL library
	- RCNN (more sophisticated)
		Learn selected classes, e.g. chairs, windows, walls
		
2. Illumination properties, e.g. lighting conditions 
	- Can infer location of the light source from the 3D geometry. No need for manual labeling. 
	- Intrinsic image decomposition to estimate the illumination 

3. Make it user friendly, e.g. drag or drop!
